Product-focused Product Designer exploring systems, clarity, and design at scale

Hi, I’m Asmaa 👋🏽

I’m a product-focused Product Designer interested in systems, clarity, and how design decisions hold up across cultures and everyday use.

My work sits at the intersection of product design, research, and visual storytelling. I care about how technology shows up in people’s lives. Especially when identity, access, and scale are involved.
